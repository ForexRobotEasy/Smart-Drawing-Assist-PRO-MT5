# Smart Drawing Assist PRO MT5

This code is a sample implementation of the Smart Drawing Assist PRO MT5 software developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. This software provides various features for drawing objects on charts, automating drawing processes, recognizing patterns, and executing trading functions.

## Customizable Object Color Option

The `SetObjectColor` function allows users to set the color of the drawing objects. The `color` parameter specifies the desired color and can be passed as an integer value.

## Line Width Adjustment Feature

The `SetLineWidth` function allows users to adjust the width of the drawing lines. The `width` parameter specifies the desired line width and can be passed as an integer value.

## Automated Drawing Feature

The software provides three functions for automated drawing: `DrawZigZag`, `DrawPatterns`, and `DrawShapes`. These functions can be customized to automatically draw zigzags, patterns, and shapes on the chart.

## Pattern Recognition Algorithm

The `RecognizePattern` function implements a pattern recognition algorithm to analyze market trends and make predictions. This algorithm can be customized to suit specific trading strategies.

## Trading Functions

The software provides two trading functions: `OpenOrder` and `CloseOrder`. The `OpenOrder` function allows users to open a new order with the specified type, volume, price, stop loss (sl), and take profit (tp). The `CloseOrder` function allows users to close an existing order of the specified type.

## OnTick Function

The `OnTick` function is executed on every tick and can be customized to execute trading functions based on the pattern recognition algorithm's predictions.

## Initialization Function

The `OnInit` function is executed during the initialization of the software and can be used to add any necessary initialization code.

## Deinitialization Function

The `OnDeinit` function is executed during the deinitialization of the software and can be used to add any necessary deinitialization code.
